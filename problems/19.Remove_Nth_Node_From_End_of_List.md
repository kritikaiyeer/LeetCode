## Method 1. Two Pass Algorithm
> The problem could be simply reduced to another one: Remove the `(L - n + 1)`th node from the
> beginning in the list, where `L` is the list length. This problem is easy to solve once we
> found list Length.
>
> The "dummy" node is used to simplify some corner case such as a list with only one node, or
> removing the head of the list.

        dummy.next = head;
        // The first pass: Get the length of this list.
        int length = 0;
        while(first != null) {
            length++;   // Since node `first` is not null, increase the length by 1.
            first = first.next;
        }
        
        // The second pass: Find the (L - N + 1)th node and remove it.
        // Since this time we start from dummy node, i.e. the node before head, we remove (L - N)th node.
        length -= n;
        first = dummy;
        while(length > 0) {
            length--;
            first = first.next;
        }   // Find the (L - N)th node.
        
        // Remove the (L - N)th node.
        first.next = first.next.next;
        
        return dummy.next;

}
```

Complexity Analysis
* Time complexity : `O(L)`. The algorithm makes two traversal of the list, first to calculate list length LLL and second to find the `(L−n)`th node. There are `2L−n` operations and time complexity is `O(L)`.
* Space complexity : `O(1)`. We only used constant extra space. 



## Method 2. One Pass Algorithm
> The first pointer advances the list by `n + 1` steps from the beginning, while the second
> pointer starts from the beginning of the list. Now, both pointers are exactly separated by `n` 
> nodes apart.

Complexity Analysis
* Time complexity : `O(L)`. The algorithm makes one traversal of the list of LLL nodes. Therefore time complexity is `O(L)`.
* Space complexity : `O(1)`. We only used constant extra space.
